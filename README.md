# buddy-system
Write a program that implements the Buddy System algorithm for memory 
management.  For input the program accepts 1) the amount of total available 
memory and 2) the sequence of integers with allocation (+) or return (-) requests. 
As output, the program must print the table showing the state of the memory (in 
the same way it is demonstrated in Lecture 6 after each allocation or return. Test 
the program with the following input parameters: Two megabytes of available 
memory and the following sequence: (A: +20K), (B: +35K), (C: +90K), (D: 
+40K), (E: +240K), (D: -40K), (A: -20K), (C: -90K), (B: -35K), (E: -240K).
